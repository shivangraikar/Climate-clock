## ▶️Contributing -->
Pull requests are welcome. For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## ▶️Scope -->

Plenty of room for future scope and it is not really a huge thing to do, can alter the UI and add self classes to link multiple views, but couldn't really find any reliable resource to absorb the activities. Always open to any inputs.
